       <p>Hour of Code is an interesting platform that students learn some programming basics,
        while they are working on games to achieve goals. We have a group at ADA University to 
        work together on our homeworks. We decided to organize this event on 1st March 2023. We 
        were 4 students Asliddin Isroilov, Elmir Abdurrahmanov, Kenan Gulmammadov, and Yunsur Bagirov 
        who is a friend of Asliddin helped us to find the school as a volunteer. We organized the event at </p>

        <h2>Our Hour of Code Event</h2>
        <h3>Elmir Abdurrahmanov</h3>
          <p>Firstly, we planned time allocations for our Hour of Code lesson and we decided to spend maximum 15 minutes on the background information about our university. He had to present this presentation because the file was prepared in Azerbaijani language.
          We chose most important parts from the ppt file. If he presents all parts it will take more time. First of all, he started the presentation with the faculties that our university has and most of the students who are chosen for our lesson are interested in computer faculties. 
          he also mentioned that some faculties are related to each other for example, computer science and business administration,  economy and mathematics,  etc. Secondly, he talked about the achievements of ADA University. Elmir showed them the pictures that the students and instructors
          or professors of ADA University has won lots of awards. When I introduced picture that our university took the eighth place in Moscow International Workshop 2021, the students looked differently and in my opinion they understood that ADA University is one of the best universities
          in the world. He also showed them a picture of ADA students that now they are working at some popular companies such as Google and Amazon. Next, Elmir talked about the exchange program, which let students to study in abroad and it makes their education more interesting. He showed the picture
          of countries which consider the developed countries such as USA, UK, Japan, France and others. Then he showed them the picture of some universities that our students can choose. At least, he presented the some guidelines of entering the ADA University talked about the concessions at tuition fees.
          If they get higher results from State Exams they will have some concessions.After Elmir finished his presentation, it was time to start Hour of Code. This part was presented by Asliddin Isroilov and here how it’s gone:</p>
        <h3>Asliddin Isroilov</h3>
          <p>At first, before starting an activity, he showed them a presentation. The aim of the presentation was to interact with students, asking them questions about what they thought of programming and what they already knew. However, before moving on to the main topic discussion,
          we thought it would be very useful to explain to them Bloom’s taxonomy. It might seem unnecessary to teach young children these types of diagrams; however, our lesson was based on this idea. We wanted them to learn not only programming but also mastering any subject by demonstrating it
          with the Hour of Code event. The next part of his presentation was only questions, such as what programming is, why programming is important, and how to do it. There were many opinions on these questions, and they helped us get used to each other. Next, we officially started an Hour of Code
          with the Classic Mazi Puzzle. He explained all the concepts by watching explanation videos (the students clearly understood the English). Children were so smart and brilliant that they almost did not have any trouble understanding the concepts. Unfortunately, we could not provide an internet
          connection for all the computers. However, they could practice one by one on Asliddin's laptop. Every time, one of them stepped up and tried to solve the puzzle. We analyzed their algorithm together with the rest of the class, tried to find mistakes, and made the algorithm more precise and effective.
          Everyone could contribute to this activity. During his presentation, they remembered the topic, they understood, applied their knowledge by practicing, analyzed and evaluated other’s solutions (Just like according to blooms taxonomy). At the end, it was clear that all of them understood
          and were able to solve puzzles by themselves. After finishing classic Mazi he was planning to try one more activity from Code Combat to complete the last step on bloom’s taxonomy. In Code Combat, instead of building blocks, students had to write real code for the characters of the game 
          using Python or JS. However, time went against us, and we needed to distribute their certificates. Together with the team, we wanted to give them a memorable gift from the event. They were so happy to get the award. After an event, they asked how to continue studying, and we gave them guidelines.
          Their enthusiasm could be clearly seen in their eyes.</p>
       <h3>Kenan Gulmammadov</h3>
          <p>Kenan's main task was to shoot everything that was happening during the Hour of Code on camera. During the filming process, he tried to use all possible angels. he took a lot of key photos and videos, which we found very exciting and fun.
          Kenan also helped those children who had to face with the topic of programming for the first time, answering questions that bothered them.
